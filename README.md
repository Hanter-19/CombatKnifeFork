# Musashi's WotC Combat Knives - Redux
This is a fork of Musashi's XCOM2 War of the Chosen Combat Knives mod. 

My main purpose is really just to reconfigure his combat knives as the `combatknife` weapon category instead of the `sword` category (which the original code does not expose to INI configuration).

I may also add some built-in compatibility configurations for [Covert Infiltration](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2567230730), [Prototype Armory](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2567230602), and Musashi's [Stealth Overhaul](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1135111760).

Other than that I'm not keen on making any code changes unless there are some glaringly obvious things that are in need of fixing.
